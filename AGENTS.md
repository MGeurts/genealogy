# <GENEALOGY>

This file is for coding agents working in this repo. Follow it literally.

## Project context

- **<GENEALOGY> (`https://github.com/MGeurts/genealogy`) is a SaaS app**: a free and open-source family tree PHP application to record family members and their relationships, build with LARAVEL 12.
- **Operate like a cofounder.** Optimize for user value and speed, without compromising basic maintainability.

## Non‑negotiables

- **Do not overwrite user edits.** The user may change code between messages. If something changed, understand _why_ and build on it.
- **Keep changes simple.** Implement the smallest change that solves the problem (unless you’re writing tests).
- **Fix root causes.** When debugging, gather enough info to understand the failure and fix it at the source (not via band-aids).

## Architecture & structure (Laravel)

- **Prefer small, verb-named Actions.** Avoid generic “Service/Manager/Handler” classes.
- **Controllers stay thin.** Single-action controllers are preferred.
- **Avoid events unless necessary.** Keep code flow obvious without jumping between files.
- **Jobs are thin + idempotent.** Delegate business logic to Actions.
- **If you create a model, also create a factory + seeder.**

## Code style (PHP)

- **Document intent** for non-obvious code (explain _why_, not _what_).
- **Purpose docblocks are required.** Every class/trait/interface/enum under `app/` must have a top-level PHPDoc block explaining:
    - why the file exists,
    - why the logic was extracted there (vs inlining),
    - what callers should rely on (the “contract”) when it’s non-obvious.
- **Import namespaces.** Don’t rely on implicit/global imports.
- **Avoid ambiguous names.** No one-letter variables unless extremely local and obvious.
- **Use guard clauses** over deep nesting.
- **No debugging helpers** in committed code (`dd()`, `dump()`, etc.).
- **Do not use `final`.**
- **Never use `@`** (PHP error suppression). If you truly must, document why and prefer explicit alternatives.
- **Default to `protected`** for non-public methods/properties unless there’s a strong reason.

## Laravel conventions & dependency boundaries

- **Do things the Laravel way.** Use helpers/Collections/Facades/attributes.
- **Do not use dependency injection.** Use Facades, Real-Time Facades, or `app()`.
- **Do not call `env()`** outside config files.
- **Prefer named routes** + `route()` over hardcoded URLs (including in app code).
- **Prefer helpers over Facades** when available (e.g. `session()` over `Session::get()`).
- **Avoid raw queries.** If unavoidable, parameterize and document why.

## Data & migrations

- **Migrations should be reversible** when possible.
- **Never edit old migrations** after they’ve been merged. Create a new migration.

## Frontend (Blade + Tailwind + Alpine)

- **HTML must be tidy, valid, semantic, and accessible.**
- **Close inline tags** (`<meta />`, `<img />`, `<br />`, …).
- **Prefer landmarks** (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `footer`) over generic wrappers.
- **Keep focus outlines.** Focus states should be visible and intentional.
- **Every input needs a `<label>`** (via `for` + `id`) unless there’s a strong reason.
- **Icons:** decorative icons get `aria-hidden="true"`; informative icons need an accessible name.

### Styling (Tailwind v4)

- Prefer Tailwind utilities over custom CSS.
- If custom CSS is necessary, keep it minimal and document why.
- Extract repeated UI patterns into Blade components (don’t copy/paste huge class strings).

### Component suite (TallStackUI)

- **Use <TallStackUI> (`https://tallstackui.com/docs/v3/installation`) as the default suite for Blade components.**

### Interactivity (Alpine.js in Blade)

- Alpine code belongs in the Blade component.
- Use `x-cloak` to avoid flashes during init.
- Keep state small and local (avoid hidden global state).
- Keep ARIA attributes in sync with state (e.g. `aria-expanded`).

### Readability conventions (Blade)

- When an element has many attributes, format them one per line.
- Top-of-file Blade comment blocks use:
    - `{{--` on its own line,
    - A capitalized sentence ending in a period,
    - `--}}` on its own line.

## Testing (Pest)

- Test files mirror `./app` structure 1:1 when possible.
    - If there is no matching `app/` file, only then place tests at the root (e.g. `./tests/Feature`) with a clear justification.
- Avoid hardcoded hosts/URLs; prefer `route()` / `url()`.
- Prefer strict fakes over permissive mocks.
- Tests must be parallel-safe: avoid shared fixed file paths and clean up created files.
- Import Pest global functions (e.g. `use function Pest\Laravel\actingAs;`).
- Avoid `$this` in Pest tests; prefer the equivalent global functions.
- Use Real-Time Facades if you need to mock something resolved from the container.

## Tooling / definition of done

- **Format:** `php vendor/bin/pint --parallel`
- **Tests:** `php vendor/bin/pest --parallel` (use `--filter` when iterating)
- **Sanity:** no debug helpers left behind; migrations reversible; UI remains accessible; minimal change set.

## Default review behavior (whenever you touch code)

- **Existence check**: for every `app/` file you create or edit, confirm it earns its existence. If it’s redundant/unused/over-abstracted, prefer deleting/merging/moving it (and updating routes/usages/tests).
- **Logic check**: inside kept files, remove or simplify any code that isn’t justified (dead branches, unused options, placeholder copy, unnecessary indirection).
- **Test alignment**: keep tests mirrored to `app/` structure 1:1 when possible; update or delete tests alongside code changes.

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

- `livewire-development` — Develops reactive Livewire 4 components. Activates when creating, updating, or modifying Livewire components; working with wire:model, wire:click, wire:loading, or any wire: directives; adding real-time updates, loading states, or reactivity; debugging component behavior; writing Livewire tests; or when the user mentions Livewire, component, counter, or reactive UI.
- `pest-testing` — Tests applications using the Pest 4 PHP framework. Activates when writing tests, creating unit or feature tests, adding assertions, testing Livewire components, browser testing, debugging test failures, working with datasets or mocking; or when the user mentions test, spec, TDD, expects, assertion, coverage, or needs to verify functionality works.
- `tailwindcss-development` — Styles applications using Tailwind CSS v4 utilities. Activates when adding styles, restyling components, working with gradients, spacing, layout, flex, grid, responsive design, dark mode, colors, typography, or borders; or when the user mentions CSS, styling, classes, Tailwind, restyle, hero section, cards, buttons, or any visual/UI changes.
- `laravel-backup` — Configure and extend spatie/laravel-backup for database and file backups, cleanup strategies, health monitoring, and notifications. Activates when working with backup configuration, scheduling backups, creating custom cleanup strategies or health checks, customizing notifications, or when the user mentions backups, backup monitoring, backup cleanup, or spatie/laravel-backup.
- `medialibrary-development` — Build and work with spatie/laravel-medialibrary features including associating files with Eloquent models, defining media collections and conversions, generating responsive images, and retrieving media URLs and paths.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan

- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double-check the available parameters.

## URLs

- Whenever you share a project URL with the user, you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain/IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging

- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.
- Use the `database-schema` tool to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool

- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)

- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before trying other approaches when working with Laravel or Laravel ecosystem packages. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic-based queries at once. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. The most relevant results will be returned first.
- Do not add package names to queries; package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'.
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit".
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - words must be adjacent and in that order.
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit".
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms.

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.

## Constructors

- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters unless the constructor is private.

## Type Declarations

- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<!-- Explicit Return Types and Method Params -->

```php
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
```

## Enums

- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.

## Comments

- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless the logic is exceptionally complex.

## PHPDoc Blocks

- Add useful array shape type definitions when appropriate.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

## Database

- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries.
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## Controllers & Validation

- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

## Authentication & Authorization

- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Queues

- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

## Configuration

- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== laravel/v12 rules ===

# Laravel 12

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Laravel documentation and updated code examples.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

## Laravel 12 Structure

- In Laravel 12, middleware are no longer registered in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
- Middleware are configured declaratively in `bootstrap/app.php` using `Application::configure()->withMiddleware()`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- The `app\Console\Kernel.php` file no longer exists; use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- Console commands in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

## Database

- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 12 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models

- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

=== livewire/core rules ===

# Livewire

- Livewire allows you to build dynamic, reactive interfaces using only PHP — no JavaScript required.
- Instead of writing frontend code in JavaScript frameworks, you use Alpine.js to build the UI when client-side interactions are required.
- State lives on the server; the UI reflects it. Validate and authorize in actions (they're like HTTP requests).
- IMPORTANT: Activate `livewire-development` every time you're working with Livewire-related tasks.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.
- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Pest documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `pest-testing` every time you're working with a Pest or testing-related task.

=== tailwindcss/core rules ===

# Tailwind CSS

- Always use existing Tailwind conventions; check project patterns before adding new ones.
- IMPORTANT: Always use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Tailwind CSS documentation and updated code examples. Never rely on training data.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `tailwindcss-development` every time you're working with a Tailwind CSS or styling-related task.

=== spatie/laravel-medialibrary rules ===

## Media Library

- `spatie/laravel-medialibrary` associates files with Eloquent models, with support for collections, conversions, and responsive images.
- Always activate the `medialibrary-development` skill when working with media uploads, conversions, collections, responsive images, or any code that uses the `HasMedia` interface or `InteractsWithMedia` trait.
